# Wordpress Defaults 

This is just a standard Wordpress installation with a few additions we use for most projects.

## Assets

This directory holds css/js/img/font

## third-party

This directory holds any additional scripts to include. They can be included in functions.php via `include ABSPATH.'/third-party/filename.php';`
